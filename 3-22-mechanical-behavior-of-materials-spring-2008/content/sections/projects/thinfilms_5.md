_(b) Silicon on insulator delamination can be modeled by fracture between two dissimilar interfaces: Si and SiO2, for example. Assume that the interface blister you considered earlier is now an initial crack at the interface, and compute the fracture stress required to delaminate the film under Mode I loading. You can cite any required properties to implement a simple fracture theory such as Griffith's._

_(c) In section 4 of the Frontiers paper \[[5](#ref)\], the authors discuss Bruel's innovation as leading to the realization that fracture could be induced by shearing. What kind of mode of loading is this, and will the stress required to initiate fracture for a given material be lower in this mode than in Mode I?_

The crack propagating in the direction normal to the shear stress, so the load is Mode III.

The stress required to initiate fracture for a given material will be higher in this mode than in Mode I. Mode I fracture is preceded only by linear elastic deformation. Mode III fracture is preceded by macroscopic yielding. The Gc values (fracture toughness) for Mode III fracture are typically higher than for Mode I and Mode II fracture as a result of increased crack tip blunting (which raises ρ) and greater values of ε.
