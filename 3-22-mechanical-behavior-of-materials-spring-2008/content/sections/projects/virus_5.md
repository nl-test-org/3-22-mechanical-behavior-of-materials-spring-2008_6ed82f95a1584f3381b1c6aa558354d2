_(b) One of the cool things about a virus is that after the prohead shoots in the genetic material into the host cell (say, a bacterium), the genetic material is replicated until there is so much pressure that the host cell fractures. Assuming this is an E. coli bacterium with an initial crack size equal to the width of the prohead, find the Griffith fracture strength of the E. coli. You'll have to assume some properties to do this, so cite and justify these._

Assumptions (from literature):

*   crack size, a = 70 nm \[[1](#References)\]  
      
     
*   Elastic modulus, E = 0.4 GPa \[[2](#References), [3](#References)\]  
      
     
*   Surface energy, γ = 52 mN/m \[[4](#References), [5](#References)\]  
      
     

Computation:

σ = (2Eγ/πa)(1/2) = 13.8 MPa

_(c) Ivanovska, et al. \[[1](#References)\] says the virus capsids are tough, but we said in class that this is the strain energy density up to the point of fracture. Assuming the fracture strength of a virus is 3 times the computed yield strength from PS3, and that the virus deforms in a linear elastic-linear strain hardening plastic mode up to the point of fracture, compute the toughness UT. Discussion on p. 7604 of their paper is also helpful._

From PS3 we calculated the yield stress to be 2.2 MPA and thus we can assume the fracture stress to be 3 times this value or 6.6 MPA.

From the following figures, taken from Ivanovska, et al., we see that the prohead dimension along the axis of stress/strain is 38 nm (Fig. 1). From Fig. 3, we see that the total strain distance the AFM tip moved from contact to fracture to be 62 nm - 29 nm = 33 nm. Thus the strain experienced by the prohead at fracture (rupture) is 33 nm/38 nm = .85.

Applying these values and the assumption of linear elastic and linear strain hardening we get a stress/strain curve as shown below.

The toughness can be computed from the figure below by finding the area under the stress/strain curve.

1/2\*.29\*2.2 MPa + (.85 - .29)2.2 MPa + 1/2(.85 - .29)(6.6 MPa - 2.2 MPa) = **2.783 MPa**
